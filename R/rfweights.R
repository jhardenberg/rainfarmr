#' Derive weights from a fine-scale precipitation climatology
#' @description Weights for downscaling are computed interpolating a fine-scale
#' climatology to the target grid and dividing it by an averaged version of itself.
#' A suitable climatology could be represented for example by a fine-scale
#' precipitation climatology from a high-resolution regional climate model
#' (see e.g. Terzago et al. 2018), a local high-resolution gridded climatology
#' from observations, or a reconstruction such as those which can be downloaded
#' from the WORLDCLIM (http://www.worldclim.org) or CHELSA (http://chelsa-climate.org)
#' websites. The latter data will need to be converted to NetCDF format before
#' being used (see for example the GDAL tools (https://www.gdal.org).
