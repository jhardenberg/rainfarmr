Description: An implementation of the RainFARM (Rainfall Filtered Autoregressive Model) stochastic precipitation downscaling method (Rebora et al. (2006) <doi:10.1175/JHM517.1>). Adapted for climate downscaling according to D'Onofrio et al. (2018) <doi:10.1175/JHM-D-13-096.1> and with fine-scale orographic weights Terzago et al. (2018) <doi:10.5194/nhess-18-2825-2018>. The RainFARM method is based on the extrapolation to small scales of the Fourier spectrum of a large-scale precipitation field using a fixed logarithmic slope and random phases, followed by a nonlinear transformation of the resulting linearly correlated stochastic field. RainFARM allows to generate ensembles of downscaled spatiotemporal precipitation fields whose statistical properties are consistent with the small-scale statistics of observed precipitation, based only on knowledge of the large-scale precipitation field.
